  mk_to_inner : hol_type -> term

  makes the projection from an outer type to an inner type
  type_of (mk_to_inner ty) = ty --> 'U
                  (actually: 'a --> 'U, but we only care about the instance at 'a = ty)

  bool_to_inner = Boolean
  fun_to_inner a_to_inner b_to_inner f =
    Abstract (range a_to_inner) (range b_to_inner) (λx. b_to_inner (f (finv a_to_inner x)))`

  mk_to_inner bool = bool_to_inner
  mk_to_inner (a --> b) = fun_to_inner ^(mk_to_inner a) ^(mk_to_inner b)
  mk_to_inner ty = to_inner [ty]

  tag : hol_type -> 'U -> 'U
  tag s x = tag t y ⇒ (s,x) = (t,y)
  and tag s x is not a boolean or a function
  and the image of a set is again a set

  to_inner ty = tag [ty] o @f. ∃x. BIJ f UNIV {a | mem a x}

  term_to_cert : term -> thm
  suppose tm deeply embeds as [tm]
  and type_of tm = ty
  term_to_cert tm

  produces
    asms ⊢ termsem sig int val [tm] = ^(mk_to_inner ty) tm
  where sig, int, val are variables, and
  asms constrain them
    in particular
      (a) good_context (well-formedness of the sig int and val)
      (b) instances of term constants appearing in tm have their intended values
      (c) wf_to_inner assumptions for type variables and type constants appearing in tm
      (d) term variables appearing in tm have their intended (outer) values
